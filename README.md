# Mechanical Keyboard Sound Simulator

This application allows users to simulate the sound of a mechanical keyboard by associating custom audio files to key presses. 
Users can assign any audio file to a specific key, enabling a personalized typing experience with realistic mechanical keyboard sounds.
Ideal for those who want to add a tactile audio dimension to their typing, without the need for a physical mechanical keyboard.
This application is a simplified version of [Mechvibes DX](https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes-dx) created by Hải Nguyễn.
